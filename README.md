# evaporate
Generate soft matter blends via simulated solvent evaporation

Solvent evaporation protocol implemented as a bash script (which assumes the use of GROMACS) used to produce soft matter morphologies as described in [JACS 139 (10), 3697-3705](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b11717). All the files required to run the evaporation of [JACS 139 (10), 3697-3705](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b11717) can be found at [the Martini portal](http://cgmartini.nl/index.php/simulated-evaporation-and-scattering).
